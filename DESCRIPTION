Description: In a classic work, Buchanan and Tullok (1962) argued that the optimal k-majority rule minimizes the sum of external costs and decision costs. We analyze the optimal k-majority rule in terms of expected utility and compare our results to other recent developments in this literature. More specifically, we replace Buchanan and Tullock's external cost function with expected utility function then determine which k-majority rule maximizes the difference between an individual's expected utility from passing a policy and their decision costs.
